# 🌍 50-Language Speech-to-Speech Translator

This is a multimodal demo that transcribes, translates, and voices speech by chaining multiple open models together.  
It provides a simple end-to-end speech translator experience across 50 languages.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

The application follows a linear processing pipeline:

1. **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**  
   Uses **Whisper (Large v3 Turbo)** to transcribe spoken audio into text.

2. **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**  
   Uses **mBART-50** to translate the transcribed text into one of 50 supported languages.

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
   Uses **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** to synthesize speech in the target language.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Models were chosen to balance **language coverage**, **latency**, and **availability** on Hugging Face Spaces.
- Larger models that frequently sleep were avoided to ensure consistent demo uptime.
